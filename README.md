Computational physics PHYS 4810 

# Getting Started

Do the following before the first class:
- You need a Google Account to use Colaboratory
- Go to Google's [Colaboratory Platform](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true "Colaboratory Platform")
- Click on the New Python Noteook
- Now you will see a new notebook where you can type in python code
- After you  enter code, type <shift>+<enter> to execute the code cell.
- A full introduction to the notebook environment is out of scope for the Lecture 0, but many can be found with a simple google search 
- We will be using notebooks from this repository during the Lecture 0, so you should be familiar with how to import them into Colaboratory.
- Now you can open the File menu at the top left and select Open Notebook which will open a dialogue box.
- Select the GitHub tab in the dialogue box.
From here you can enter the url for the github repo: https://github.com/quantum-intelligence/computational-physics and hit <enter>.
- This will show you a list of the Notebooks available in the repo.
- Select the Lecture0.ipynb file to open it and work through it.
