Computational physics PHYS 4810 

# Getting Started

Do the following before the first class:

### Explore python on the cloud using Google Colab: 
- Get a Google account. You need a Google account to use Colaboratory.
- Go to Google's [Colaboratory Platform](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true "Colaboratory Platform").
- Click on the New Python Noteook.
- Now you will see a new notebook where you can type in python code/
- After you enter some python code, type \<shift\>+\<enter\> to execute the code cell.
- A full introduction to the notebook environment is out of scope for Lecture 1, but many tutorials can be found with a simple google search.

### Access the notebooks for in-class discussions:

- We will be using notebooks from this repository during the Lecture 1, so you should be familiar with how to import them into Colaboratory.
- Open the File menu at the top left and select "Open Notebook". which will open a dialogue box.
- Select the GitHub tab in the dialogue box.
From here you can enter the url for the github repo: https://github.com/quantum-intelligence/computational-physics and hit \<enter\>.
- This will show you a list of the Notebooks available in the repo.
- Be sure to select the "main" repo.
- Select the CP_Lecture1.ipynb file to open it and work through it.
